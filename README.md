The Delta-Beast 300 provides electrical generation when the grid has failed.  Our product is not subject to EMP paralysis, solid-state controllers (discrete silicon, computer chips and solar cells), and/or various fuels for dependency.

Why is the Delta-Beast 300 so special? Just have a few batteries available, place into the Delta-Beast 300, and itâ€™s operational!  The batteries allow the Delta-Beast 300 to function for long periods of usage.  In a pre-EMP world, solar cells can be harnessed to be a backup charging source to keep batteries at their full potential.  This increases use time of the Delta-Beast 300 for the purpose of electrical availability.  When that unforeseen EMP occurs, you will have the only generation system that will keep your electrical devices functioning.

The Delta-Beast 300 will provide 300 watts of usable electricity.  The unit can also provide enough charge for your cell phone and other light wattage electronics.
